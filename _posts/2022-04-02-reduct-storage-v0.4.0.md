Hey everyone!

I'm happy to announce that Reduct Storage [v0.4.0](https://github.com/reduct-storage/reduct-storage/releases/tag/v0.4.0)
and Client C++ SDK [v0.4.0](https://github.com/reduct-storage/reduct-cpp/releases/tag/v0.4.0) have been released!

This is the latest conception proof release, where I refactored structure of data blocks and made all write/read operation
asynchronous. Now the storage has no limitations for the size of records and the amount of stored data.

We're freezing the HTTP API and focusing on [Client Python SDK](https://github.com/reduct-storage/reduct-py) 
and the CLI admin tool.
