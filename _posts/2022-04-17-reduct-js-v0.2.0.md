Hey everyone!

[JavaScript SDK v0.2](https://github.com/reduct-storage/reduct-js/releases/tag/v0.2.0) has been released! It makes
creating a new bucket more convenient. If you need to create a new bucket if it doesn't exist, you had to write something
like this:

```javascript
 let bucket;
  try {
    bucket = await reductClient.createBucket('bucket');
  } catch (err) {
    bucket = await reductClient.getBucket('bucket');
  }
```

Now it is much easier:

```javascript
 const bucket = await reductClient.getOrCreateBucket('bucket');
```
