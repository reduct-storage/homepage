The [MQTT protocol][4] is very popular in IoT applications. It is a simple way to connect different data sources
with your application by using a publish/subscribe model. Sometimes you may want to keep a history of your MQTT data to
use
it for model training, diagnostics or metrics. If your data sources provide different formats of data that can
not be interpreted as time series of floats, Reduct Storage is what you need.

Let's make a simple MQTT application to see how it works.

### Prerequisites

For this usage example we have the following requirements:

* Linux AMD64
* Docker and Docker Compose
* NodeJS >= 16

If you're an Ubuntu user, use this command to install the dependencies:

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install docker-compose nodejs
```

### Run MQTT Broker and Reduct Storage with Docker Compose

The easiest way to run the broker and the storage is to use Docker Compose. So we should create a `docker-compose.yml`
file in the example's folder with the services:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  reduct-storage:
    image: ghcr.io/reduct-storage/reduct-storage:latest
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    ports:
      - "8383:8383"

  mqtt-broker:
    image: eclipse-mosquitto:1.6
    ports:
      - "1883:1883"
```

Then run the configuration:

```
docker-compose up
```

Docker Compose downloaded the images and ran the containers. Pay attention that we published ports 1883 for MQTT
protocol and 8383 for [Reduct HTTP API](https://docs.reduct-storage.dev/http-api).

### Write NodeJS script

Now we're ready to make hands dirty with code. Let's initialize the NPM package and
install [MQTT Client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/async-mqtt) and
[JavaScript Client SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reduct-js).

```
$ npm init
$ npm install --save reduct-js async-mqtt 
```

When we have all the dependencies installed, we can write the script:

```javascript
const MQTT = require('async-mqtt');
const {Client} = require('reduct-js');

MQTT.connectAsync('tcp://localhost:1883').then(async (mqttClient) => {
  await mqttClient.subscribe('mqtt_data');

  const reductClient = new Client('http://localhost:8383');
  const bucket = await reductClient.getOrCreateBucket('mqtt');

  mqttClient.on('message', async (topic, msg) => {
    const data = msg.toString();
    await bucket.write('mqtt_data', data);
    console.log('Received message "%s" from topic "%s" was written', data,
        topic);
  });

}).catch(error => console.error(error));
```

Let's look at the code in detail. First, we have to connect to the MQTT broker
and subscribe to a topic. The topic name just random string, which producers should know.
In our case it is `mqtt_data`:

```javascript

MQTT.connectAsync('tcp://localhost:1883').then(async (mqttClient) => {
  await mqttClient.subscribe('mqtt_data');

  // rest of code
}).catch(error => console.error(error));
```

If the MQTT connection is successful, we can start dealing with Reduct Storage.
To start writing data there, we need a bucket. We create a bucket with the name `mqtt` or
get an existing one:

```javascript
const reductClient = new Client('http://localhost:8383');
const bucket = await reductClient.getOrCreateBucket('mqtt');
```

The last step is to write the received message to the storage. We must use a callback
for event `message`, to catch it. Then we write the message to entry `mqtt_data`:

```javascript
mqttClient.on('message', async (topic, msg) => {
  const data = msg.toString();
  await bucket.write('mqtt_data', data);
  console.log('Received message "%s" from topic "%s" was written', data,
      topic);
});
```

When we call `bucket.write` we create an entry in the bucket if it doesn't exist yet.
Then we write data to the entry with the current timestamp.
Now our MQTT data is safe and sound in the storage, and we can access them by using
the same [SDK][2].

### Publish data to MQTT topic

When you launch the script, it does nothing because there is no data from MQTT. You have to publish something to topic
`mqtt_data`. I prefer to use [mosquitto_pub](https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto_pub-1.html). For Ubuntu users, it is a
part of the `mosquitto-clients` package:

```
$ sudo apt-get install mosquitto-clients
$ mosuitto_pub -t mqtt_data -m "Hello, world!"
```

### Getting data from Reduct Storage

Now you know how to get data from MQTT and write it to Reduct Storage, but we need a little NodejS script to read
the data from the storage:

```javascript
const {Client} = require('reduct-js');

const client = new Client('http://localhost:8383');

client.getBucket('mqtt').then(async (bucket) => {
  let data = await bucket.read('mqtt_data');
  console.log('Last record: %s', data);

  // Get data for the last hour
  const stopTime = BigInt(Date.now() * 1000);
  const startTime = stopTime - 3_600_000_000n;

  const records = await bucket.list('mqtt_data', startTime, stopTime);
  for (const record of records) {
    data = await bucket.read('mqtt_data', record.timestamp);
    console.log('Found record "%s" with timestamp "%d"', data, record.timestamp);
  }

}).catch(error => console.error(error));

```

To read the latest record in the entry is very easy:

```javascript
let data = await bucket.read('mqtt_data');
```

But to take some random record, you have to know its timestamp. A typical use case would be to read data for some
timeinterval. You should use method `Bucket.list` to get timestamps of records for the interval. Then you can
read them by using `Bucket.read`:

```javascript
const stopTime = BigInt(Date.now() * 1000);
const startTime = stopTime - 3_600_000_000n;

const records = await bucket.list('mqtt_data', startTime, stopTime);
for (const record of records) {
  data = await bucket.read('mqtt_data', record.timestamp);
  console.log('Found record "%s" with timestamp "%d"', data, record.timestamp);
}
```

Pay attention, the storage uses timestamps with microsecond precision, so we can't use `Date` class and `number` type.
What is why we use `BigInt`.

### Conclusion

As you can see, the MQTT protocol and Reduct Storage very simple technologies that can be used together very easily in NodeJS.
You can find the source code of the example [here](https://github.com/reduct-storage/reduct-mqtt-example). If you have any
questions or problems running it. Feel free to make [an issue](https://github.com/reduct-storage/reduct-js/issues/new).

I hope this tutorial has been helpful. Thanks!
