Hey everyone!

I was very busy the last few days. As a result, I've released the first version of 
[Javascript Client SDK](https://github.com/reduct-storage/reduct-js) for
Reduct Storage. 

Now you can use the storage from the web browsers and NodeJs
applications. It supports the latest [Reduct Storage HTTP API v0.4](https://docs.reduct-storage.dev/http-api)
and has built-in TypeScript declarations. 

<!--more-->

### Getting Started

You can install the SDK as an [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reduct-js):

```
npm install reduct-js
```

Launch the storage server as a Docker container:

```
docker run -p 8383:8383 -v ${PWD}/data:/data ghcr.io/reduct-storage/reduct-storage:latest
```

Then run this example in NodeJs:

```javascript
const {Client} = require("reduct-js")

const main = async () => {
  const client = new Client("http://127.0.0.1:8383");

  const bucket = await client.createBucket("bucket");

  const ts = Date.now() * 1000;
  await bucket.write("entry-1", "Hello, World!", ts);
  data = await bucket.read("entry-1", ts);
  console.log(data);
};

main()
  .then(() => console.log("done"))
  .catch((err) => console.error("oops: ", err));
```
