Hey everyone!

A week ago I've released [Reduct Storage v0.2.0](https://reduct-storage.dev/release/storage/reduct-storage-v0.2.0/).
Now I've updated its C++ SDK Client and released version [v0.2.0](https://github.com/reduct-storage/reduct-cpp/releases/tag/v0.2.0).
The library completely implements Reduct Storage HTTP API v0.2.0, and you can use it with the token authorization:

<!--more-->

{% highlight cpp %}
IClient::Options opts {
    .api_token = "SOME_API_TOKEN",    // leave empty to use anonymous access
};

std::unique_ptr<IClient> client = IClient::Build("http://127.0.0.1:8383", opts);
{% endhighlight %}
